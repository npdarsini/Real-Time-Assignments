Another method you can utilize is insertion sort. Find out the length of each word as you read the sentence and insert it into its proper place in the array, using insertion sort. The array should be of the same structure type used in the previous steps. In any case you have to find out the length of each word in the sentence. Instead of storing the words in an array, you can try the following steps: Find out the length of each word in the sentence and store it in an array (the length, not the word itself).
